# Travelling-Salesman-Problem
Project created with Unity 2020.03

Program for finding the best solution to the Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP) for a certain number of points (indices). This is done by testing permutations made with Lexicographic ordering and evaluating the distance of each one to find the shortest path.
