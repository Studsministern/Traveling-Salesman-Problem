# Travelling-Salesman-Problem
Project created with Unity 2020.03

Program for finding the best solution to the Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP) for a certain number of points (indices). The program has code both for Heap's algorithm, and by testing permutations made with Lexicographic ordering.

(*Despite the calculations with Heap's algoritm being seemingly faster, it does all calculations before showing the shortest path. This results in very slow visualisation when calculating the shortest distance for 10 or more points!*)
